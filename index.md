# Background and Problem Statement

## Revitalizing democracy: Assessing the quality and effectiveness of CrowdLaw initiatives in Madrid

## Background
The Governance Lab at New York University (NYU GovLab) is spearheading a series of initiatives to develop and implement "CrowdLaw", the practice of using technology to tap the intelligence and expertise of the public in order to improve the quality of lawmaking. NYU GovLab is currently collaborating with the Madrid City Council to improve upon the work they are doing with Decide Madrid, an online platform created by the Madrid City Council to enable public participation in Madrid's budgeting and legislative drafting processes. Since 2015, Madrid has used the platform to enable citizens to have a voice in deciding how to spend 160 million euros.

## Problem Statement
Madrid City Council has several years of experience now with CrowdLaw initiatives through the Decide Madrid Platform. They have signed an agreement with NYU GovLab to come up with an evaluation system to measure the impact  of Decide Madrid, both in terms of legitimacy of the resulting policies as well as in regards to quality. The evaluation strategy could be used to inform both Madrid's program and initiatives by other municipalities using Consul, the open source platform which Decide Madrid is based on.

## Key Questions:
* What metrics and indicators can Madrid City Council use to evaluate the quality of the process?
* What metrics and indicators can be used to track the level and quality of participation?
* What set of indicators could be used to evaluate the quality of law/policy proposals?
* What set of indicators could be used to evaluate the impact  of CrowdLaw on the legitimacy and quality of legislation and projects produced through or influenced by these processes
