mixed integer quadratic optimization

algorithmic, optimization-based method for jointly balancing such objectives

Chatterjee Steps:

1. Examine the variables one by one, looking for outliers and making transformations.

2. Construct pairwise scatterplots for each variable, if possible. Examine the correlation matrix and delete redundant variables. Calculate the condition number of the correlation matrix to understand the extent of the effect of multicollinearity.

3. Fit the full ordinary least squares model and delete variables with insignificant t-tests. For the reduced model, examine the residuals for linearity, heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, and outliers.
4. See if additional variables can be dropped and/or if new variables need to be brought in. Repeat step 3.

5. Check variance inflation factors (VIFs) and residual diagnostics.

6. Validate the fitted model on a test set or use other methods such as cross validation, bootstrapping, etc.
